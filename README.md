My own version using this template: https://brunhild.cn/nonefffds

## New Features(Only in index.html):

* Dark mode(Auto toggled by your browser)
* Updated to Bootstrap 4
* floating QR Code

## TO-DO

* External CSS
* Style enhance
* Back-end Inplementation

## Want statistics?

Currently there's no way for me to implement that right now, because it requires back-end technologies.
But you still can use some short-link services that provide statistics for the alternative use.
I'm still managed to learn something about PHP, but maybe until like 10yrs later for me to get it implemented.

## How to use

Just edit the html file, change the links and titles, and put this on your web server.
